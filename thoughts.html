                                <b>Have I Lost Your Attention Yet? </b>
                                Buzzword, yes. Representative of a turning point in traditional consumer banking, absolutely. FinTech is first to mind in consumer banking. According to the Pew Research Center, 77% of Americans own a smartphone [1] and check their phones 52 times per day [2]. Insights from Facebook state that on average people spend 1.7 seconds with any given piece of mobile content [3]. Businesses now compete for attention. This means customer-centricity, and speed-to-innovate and implement are the new drivers in delivering the best experience for customers and achieving sustainability for the business. 
                                </br></br>
                                Back to FinTech. It matters because digital interaction has heightened consumer expectations, amounting to pressures on back-end work and the continual deployment of new features. These capabilities are inherent in start-ups and lag in traditional financial institutions. Cloud infrastructure, extensive funding, and nap pods enable new companies to build for customer experience, operate efficiently, and attract the top engineering and leadership talent. KMPG notes that at the end of 2017, global FinTech funding exceeded $31 billion USD [4]. JP Morgan is set to spend $10.8 billion on technology in 2018 [5]. Legacy banks – some over 200 years old – built-up through extensive M&A have to 1) modernize their technology infrastructure and 2) optimize their rate of adoption. 
                                </br></br>
                                Challenges exist for FinTech companies. They must outperform already high growth expectations and fend off other startups going after their piece. #cite number of FinTechs/Financial Institutions, etc. / size of pie (market caps, revenues, etc.)# With investor and competitor pressures, a pursuit of licensee-required services in increasingly in question. Square Inc.’s 2017 FDIC application for an Industrial Loan Company license that would allow it the collection of government-insured deposits [6], is one example, although Square Inc. withdrew its application in 2018 [6]. Not all is negative for legacy banks either. Trust and friction. Government assurance is big. With deep oversight and some protection guarantees, the government does well by encouraging strong security practices within the financial sector. As traditional banks evolve their operating models, opportunities to strengthen market position certainly exist.

                                <b>New York Wants to Innovate Too.</b>
                                In the U.S., FinTech is being fought for coast to cast. Goldman Sachs launched ‘Marcus’, an online banking business in 2016 [7]. Marcus is the Investment Bank’s first take on the consumer industry and is marketed toward average consumers, highlighting simple financial products with favorable features like high savings rates. According to Bloomberg, Marcus has already attracted 1.5 million customers and made $3 billion in loans [7]. Given this is Goldman’s first foray into consumer banking; they are able to achieve cost and operational efficiencies as they are built like a technology start-up. It is likely that Marcus is running on new cloud infrastructure (public?)  and employs a healthy workforce of software engineers and data scientists. JP Morgan Chase recently created Finn, a mobile application targeted to underbanked individuals (where branches aren’t) [8]. Finn offers quick signup, a simple three-component interface, aesthetic charts for budget analysis, a feature to encourage savings through customizable rules, and easy money transfer with Zelle [8].  New products under new brand names isn’t the only sign of commitment. As of 2017, Citigroup has a partnership with Cornell University’s new tech campus in NYC to tap into emerging talent [9].

                                <b>You Should be Excited.</b>
                                Regardless of age or user growth there’s a story in speed and market sizing.  New market entrants are quickly trying to address new markets and attack smaller segments like ______ and _____. Traditional banks are fighting to preserve existing market share by allowing their products to play nice with competitors and partnering with newer brands like open API’s and Goldman Sachs partnering with Apple.
                                </br></br>
                                All this gets back to us and our attention. As FinTech companies and banks compete, we reap the rewards. A marketplace for loans, free-stock trading, email based payments, the list goes on.
                                </br></br></br>
